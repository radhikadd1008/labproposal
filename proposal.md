# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Train Fare Calculator

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A system which will calculate the cost of your trip via train.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

This software will ask the user its starting and ending destinations. From this information, it will calculate how much the passenger has to pay for the trip. This system will implement many coding techniques such as loops and dictionaries to provide the fare for the trip. Distances will be stored for each destination to accurately calculate how much the passenger has to pay. Another feature on this software will be that the number of passengers travelling in a group will be able to pay together. Fares will be adjusted based on this factor as well.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The software can calculate a fare for the trip of the passenger.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The software can calculate a fare for the trip of the number of passengers.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The software will accurately be able to calculate the fare of the trip based on the distances and times.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to research common train distances and prices for those distances. I will need to strengthen my skills on using dictionaries and storing data as this will be very important in my project. I might be implementing group discounts so if that is the case, I will need to do research on how that works in terms of transit as well.
